# Screen recorder

- how scree recorder works

> screen recorder, is a screen recorder made in js that allows you to record your screen at a rate of 30 frames per second, you can stop recording whenever you want and the recording will automatically be saved on your PC in the following path /download/capture. webm

- screen recorder uses some external library to manage recording and frames

> no screen recorder does not depend on any library for recording management, everything is done natively with the browser API

> No, currently the function of being able to record audio has not been incorporated, along with the video.

- I can take the code and make my own screen recorder?

> Of course, this repository is open source, you can download and modify the code as much as you want, just don't forget to give the repo a little star to know what you liked

- I can contribute to the project?
